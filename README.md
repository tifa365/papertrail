## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 📊 Data Sources

The project uses newspaper data for German regions, organized in the following files:

### Primary Data Files

#### `public/newspaper_data_fixed.json` (Added: April 28, 2025)
- **Structure**: Array of newspaper entries with temporal and ownership data
- **Total entries**: 1,149
- **Unique newspapers**: 791
- **Key fields**:
  - `Titel`: Newspaper name
  - `AGS`: Amtlicher Gemeindeschlüssel (region code)
  - `Besitz/Verlag/Anmerkungen`: Publisher and ownership information
  - Temporal data: Years 1989-2023 (binary presence indicator)
- **Characteristics**: Rich metadata including publisher history and ownership changes

#### `public/zeitungen_by_ags.json` (Generated from transformation)
- **Structure**: Object indexed by normalized AGS codes (without leading zeros, e.g., "1001")
- **Total entries**: 1,187 (newspapers across all regions)
- **Unique newspapers**: 730
- **Regional entries**: 402
- **Key fields per newspaper**:
  - `name`: Newspaper name
  - `verlag`: Publisher
  - `erscheinungsort`: Place of publication
  - `bundesland`: Federal state
  - `website`: Website URL
- **Characteristics**: Optimized for map visualization, currently used by the application
- **Generation**: Automatically generated by `transform-newspaper-data.cjs` from source files
- **Data quality**: 89.6% with websites, 99.2% with publisher data (100% preservation of source)

#### `archive/zeitungen_by_ags_original.json`
- **Purpose**: Primary source file for the transformation process
- **Structure**: Object indexed by AGS codes (with leading zeros, e.g., "01001")
- **Total entries**: 1,186 newspapers
- **Data completeness**: 89.6% with websites, 99.2% with publisher data
- **Usage**: This file is the single source of truth, containing all existing metadata
- **Note**: Uses 5-digit AGS codes with leading zeros that must be normalized for map compatibility

### Data Relationships

- **Duplicates across regions**: Newspapers serving multiple regions appear multiple times
  - Example: "Die Rheinpfalz" appears in 15 different regions
  - Example: "Rheinische Post" appears in 13 different regions
  - This explains why zeitungen_by_ags.json has 1,187 entries from only 730 unique newspapers

- **Data completeness**: The transformation preserves 100% of existing metadata
  - 89.6% of newspapers have websites in the source data
  - 99.2% of newspapers have publisher information
  - Any missing fields represent genuine gaps in the original source, not transformation losses

### Data Transformation Process

The application uses `zeitungen_by_ags.json` for map visualization, which is generated from the original data source using the `transform-newspaper-data.cjs` script.

#### Transformation Approach

**Philosophy**: Preserve 100% of existing source data, don't try to fix missing data

The transformation follows a simple two-step process:

1. **Load and normalize** `archive/zeitungen_by_ags_original.json`
   - Strip leading zeros from AGS codes to match geodata format
   - Example: `"01001"` → `"1001"`
   - Preserve ALL existing newspaper data (name, website, verlag, etc.)

2. **Optionally enrich** publisher data from `newspaper_data_fixed.json`
   - Only add publisher info if more detailed than existing data
   - Uses exact AGS + name matching (no fuzzy matching needed)

#### Current Data Quality (as of final transformation)

**Output file**: `public/zeitungen_by_ags.json`

**Statistics**:
- **402 regions** total
- **400/400 regions** match geodata (100% map coverage)
- **1,187 total newspapers** across all regions
- **1,063 with websites** (89.6%)
- **1,177 with publisher data** (99.2%)
- **1,064 with erscheinungsort** (89.6%)
- **1,064 with bundesland** (89.6%)

**Key Achievement**: 100% preservation of existing data from source files

The 10.4% of newspapers without websites and 0.8% without publisher data represent genuine gaps in the original source data, not transformation losses.

#### Running the Transformation

```bash
node transform-newspaper-data.cjs
```

This will regenerate `public/zeitungen_by_ags.json` from the source files.
